          Personal Data in relation to the purposes for which they were originally collected or otherwise processed;
          you
          withdraw your consent to any processing which requires consent; the processing is for direct marketing
          purposes;
          and the Personal Data have been unlawfully processed. However, there are certain general exclusions of the
          right
          to erasure, including where processing is necessary: for exercising the right of freedom of expression and
          information;
          for compliance with a legal obligation; or for establishing, exercising or defending legal claims.</p>

        <p class="mb-0"> <span class="textColorBlue">The right to restrict processing</span>:</p>
        <p> In certain circumstances you have the right for the processing of your Personal Data to be restricted. This
          is the
          case where: you do not think that the Personal Data we hold about you is accurate; your data is being
          processed
          unlawfully, but you do not want your data to be erased; it is no longer necessary for us to hold your
          Personal
          Data for the purposes of our processing, but you still require that Personal Data in relation to a legal
          claim;
          and you have objected to processing, and are waiting for that objection to be verified. Where processing has
          been
          restricted for one of these reasons, we may continue to store your Personal Data. However, we will only
          process
          it for other reasons: with your consent; in relation to a legal claim; for the protection of the rights of
          another
          natural or legal person; or for reasons of important public interest.</p>
        <p class="mb-0"><span class="textColorBlue">The right to object to processing</span>: </p>
        <p>You can object to us processing your Personal Data on grounds relating to your particular situation, but
          only as
          far as our legal basis for the processing is that it is necessary for: the performance of a task carried out
          in
          the public interest, or in the exercise of any official authority vested in us; or the purposes of our
          legitimate
          interests or those of a third party. If you make an objection, we will stop processing your personal
          information
          unless we are able to: demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing, and that these
          legitimate
          grounds override your interests, rights and freedoms; or the processing is in relation to a legal claim.</p>
        <p class="mb-0"><span class="textColorBlue">The right to data portability</span>:</p>
        <p>You have the right to request that your Personal Data be moved, copied or transferred from one database,
          storage
          or IT environment to another.</p>

          complaint
          with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do this in the EU member state of Your
          habitual
          residence, Your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement.
          <p class="mb-0"><span class="textColorBlue">The right to withdraw consent</span>:</p>
          <p>To the extent that the legal basis we are relying on for processing Your Personal Data is consent, You are
            entitled
            to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the
            withdrawal.</p>
          <p class="mb-0"><span class="textColorBlue">The right to object to direct marketing</span>:</p>
          <p>You can choose whether we process Your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes. If You do not want Us
            to process
            Your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes, we will not process Your Personal Data for this purpose.
            You
            can exercise Your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect

        <h4 class="textColorBlue">SECURITY</h4>
        <p> We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and
          disclosure
          of your information. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before
          we
          disclose personal information to you.</p>
        <p>When our order form asks users to enter sensitive information, that information is encrypted and is
          protected with
          SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as
          Netscape
          Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just
          'surfing'.</p>
        <p> While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also protect user- information
          off-line.
          All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our
          offices.
          Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our accounting staff or a
          customer
          care representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.</p>
        <p>If you have any further concerns about security, please email our Customer Service team at

          against unauthorized
          access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information, username, password, transaction
          information
          and data stored on our Site.</p>
